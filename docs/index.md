# Welcome to the Turnroot Documentation!
Turnroot is a powerful, open-source, web-based editor for turn-based, top-down, roleplaying video games inspired by, among other sources, the *Fire Emblem* series. It's designed to be easy to use, easy to customize, and easy to share. You can make the TTRPG of your dream without needing to know how to code or how to use complex software using Turnroot. And you can do it in a weekend (if it's a small game and you don't have any other plans).

Turnroot also has a powerful game loader and game manager, allowing you to easily share your games with others. You can also play games created by others- if you don't want to make one yourself, there's others to explore! The game loader is free to use, you can find it here: [https://turnroot.com/player](https://turnroot.com/player). You can find existing games to play on [Turnroot Community](https://community.turnroot.com/c/games/finished-games/12).

## Getting Started
You can use Turnroot in two ways: locally or in the cloud.

Cloud usage requires either a monthly subscription or a one-time purchase. You can find more information on the [pricing page](https://turnroot.com/pricing). Your subscription or purchase directly supports the development of Turnroot- this is a passion project, pure and simple, and every dollar helps keep it alive.

Local usage is free, but it requires some technical expertise and comfort using a terminal/command line. 

Getting started with the cloud version is easy- just go to [editor.turnroot.com](https://editor.turnroot.com) and sign up. You can start making your game right away.

If you want to use the local version, you'll need to follow the instructions in the [Local Installation](./getting-started/local-installation.md) section.

## Community, Support, and Contributing
The gathering place for developers, gamers, gamemakers, artists, asset creators, and other Turnroot enthusiasts is the [Turnroot Community](https://community.turnroot.com). You can find help, share your games, find assets, and more there.

If you need help, you can find it on the [Turnroot Community](https://community.turnroot.com). These docs are also a good place to start. We highly recommend spending some time reading through them before you start making your game.

If you want to contribute to the development of Turnroot, please do! Please see (the contributing guide)[https://community.turnroot.com/t/contributor-guidelines/13] for more information.
