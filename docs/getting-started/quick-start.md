# Quick Start (Cloud)

Using Turnroot Editor in the cloud at [editor.turnroot.com](https://editor.turnroot.com) is the easiest way to get started with Turnroot. You can start making your game right away without installing anything. 

1. Go to [editor.turnroot.com](https://editor.turnroot.com).
2. You'll need to create an account and either buy a one-time license or subscribe to a monthly plan. If you're not ready for that yet, you can use the editor for free, but nothing will be saved, everything will be gone permanently when you close the tab. Feel free to play around and see if you like it.
3. When you're ready, click "Create Account" in the top right corner and follow the instructions.

That's it! You're ready to start making your game. In future, you'll want to click "Log In" in the top right corner to access your account.

As you run into questions, you can continue through the documentation and join our [community](https://community.turnroot.com).
