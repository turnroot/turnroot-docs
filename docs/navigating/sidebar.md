# Editor Sidebar
The sidebar is how you can move between different sub-editors in the Editor. For simplicity, these sub-editors are simply called "editors" through the documentation.

Click an editor to switch to it. Your current editor is highlighted with a lighter background.

You can _Collapse_ the sidebar to give yourself more room to work; click the checkbox at the top of the sidebar to do so. Collapsed, the sidebar will show only icons for the editors.
